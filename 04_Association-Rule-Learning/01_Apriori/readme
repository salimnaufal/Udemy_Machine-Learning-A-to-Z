Machine Learning model and dataset for Association Rule Learning using Apriori algorithm.

Association Rule Learning is a branch of machine learning where the model learns from previous data to find pattern/rule on the most closely related samples.
From this information then we can associate the findings into recommendations.
This mechanism is usually used in the recommender system like in online ecommerce (e.g : Amazon) or film provider (e.g : Netflix).

The Dataset "Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv" contains the transaction records of a shop in a span of 1 week.
There are a total of 7501 individual transactions and every row contains the information of things that are bought by a customer at one time.

In the result of Apriori algortihm, we tried to find the most closely related 2 items from the list of transactions.
The most correlated items then can be sorted by Support, Confidence, or Lift.
