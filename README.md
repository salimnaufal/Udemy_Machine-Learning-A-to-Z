# Udemy_Machine-Learning-A-to-Z-Python
Collection of codes for hands-on coding experience on online course : Udemy Machine Learning A-Z.
Instructors : Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding on the course content.
All of the codes are originally written by the instructors and their team.
What I did was rewriting the codes to apply the knowledge and theory gained in the course and to have practical coding experience on machine learning models.
