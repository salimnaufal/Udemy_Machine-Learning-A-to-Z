Machine Learning model and dataset for predicting whether or not a buyer will buy a new car model using SVM algorithm.
The model will be deployed for advertisement in social network (that's why the dataset name is "Social_Network_ads.csv").

Also, below techniques are applied.
1. To further enhance the accuracy of our model, parameter tuning will be done on the following hyperparameters :
   - C (regularization parameter)
   - kernel type (linear or rbf)
   - gamma (Kernel coefficient for ‘rbf’, ‘poly’ and ‘sigmoid’)
2. For each possible combination of hyperparameters, the model will be evaluated using k fold cross validation technique with 10 train-test set folds (cv =10).

Features : The age and salary of previous prospective buyers
Dependent Variable : Purchase history (0 : did not purchase previous car model, 1 : purchased previous car model)
